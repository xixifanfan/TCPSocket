# TCPSocket
TCPSocket for learning!
### Implement a TCPSocket class that encapsulates socket operations, providing createServerSocket for creating a TCP server and createClientSocket for creating a TCP client. 
### Utilize the singleton pattern to implement the TCPInit class, improving resource utilization; 
### use RAII to start the socket service when creating the TCPSocket pointer object for the first time and close the socket service when releasing resources.
